This project is about creating a Todo-list that allows users to create reminders for what they intend to do. A Todo consists of a title, description, due-date, priority, status such as completed, in progress, not in progress, and finally the option to include a project.This project is useful in showing which Todos are due today , upcoming, and Todoâ€™s that have already been completed. All Todos can be found in the inbox, and are assigned a default project, in the case that user's don't assign it themselves. Users also have the ability to update, read or remove their Todos.

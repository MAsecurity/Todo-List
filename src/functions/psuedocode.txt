Inbox:
  if inbox is clicked renderTodo should run, 
Today:
  if today is matching elements in renderTodo array, we must call a seperate function which calculates
  if dates matching are the same , and if so update the today sidebar, and if its clicked create a filter array and update renderTodo
Upcomming:
  same thing as Today but check if dates are above current date
Completed:
  should look for elements that are completed and render them if clicked on.
